# Strategic-Crime-Analysis
# Strategic Crime Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of urban crime data, focusing on identifying trends, patterns, and insights that can aid in strategic decision-making for public safety and resource allocation. Utilizing R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, this project explores various facets of crime data, including temporal trends, geospatial distributions, and incident resolutions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis using the `tidyverse` package.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Identifying crime hotspots with `ggplot2` and plotting geographic distributions.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Examining trends over time to understand crime dynamics.
- **Resolution Analysis**: Analyzing the outcomes of police responses and incident resolutions.

## Technologies Used
- R
- RStudio
- Libraries:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `lubridate`
  - `ggplot2`
